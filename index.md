title: Salary Pledge · Pledge to show the salary on job descriptions
---


Dear founders and CEOs,

I’ll cut to the chase. If you’re hiring, every job description you publish should show a salary or salary range.

I know you’d be bucking the trend. The vast majority of startups publish job descriptions that promise a ‘competitive salary’, and I can see why. It leaves the messy business of salary negotiation to happen in private. After all, you can find out what each candidate’s expectations are on the phone. If you can nab a great hire on less than you were expecting to pay, all the better.

Except that your careers page probably also tells the world that you care deeply about **diversity, inclusion, transparency and openness**. And you should know that when a candidate reads ‘competitive salary’, they can see you’re not walking the walk.

That’s because, whether you realise it or not, when you don’t share the salary publicly **you are perpetuating the substantial pay gap that exists for women, for people of colour, for LGBTQ+ communities and for those with disabilities**.

## ‘Competitive’ ≠ fair
As a woman, I can tell you that I’ve been brought up to be polite, not to ‘stir the pot’, and certainly not to talk about money. If I’m applying for a job and I’m on the phone with my potential future boss, I’m unlikely to bring up the topic of salary. I know that if I look too money-driven, I’ll likely be seen as cold and ruthless (even if [a man might be seen as ambitious and straight-shooting](https://www.leadershippsychologyinstitute.com/women-the-leadership-labyrinth-howard-vs-heidi/)).

When my future boss and I inevitably get round to talking about money, I might be asked, “What do you earn now?”. If I tell the interviewer, it’s likely they’ll offer me a salary in the same region, meaning that any pay gap I was experiencing before will continue.

If nothing else, stop doing this. In the last four years, fourteen US states have made it illegal to ask candidates about their salary history, and [Harvard Business School](https://hbr.org/2020/07/stop-asking-job-candidates-for-their-salary-history) found the new ban led to an average increase of 8% in pay offered to women candidates, and a huge 13% increase for Black candidates. **If you care about diversity and inclusion, don’t ask about salary history.**

Back to my fictitious job interview. If not asked about my previous salary, I’ll be asked, “What are your salary expectations?”. Now, I’m likely to both underestimate my worth and stop short of an aggressive negotiation. Why? Partly because of learned behaviours, partly because of a lack of confidence but also partly because of my inability to accurately determine my market worth (made worse because no job description I read publicly shows a salary).

As a [study published in 2020 by Hired](https://hired.com/h/wage-inequality-report#intro) stated, the candidate’s salary expectations are ‘closely tied’ to the salary ultimately offered to them, and, on average, men expect to earn more.

## There’s no excuse
In my book, there’s no excuse for not publishing a salary or salary range. If you don’t know exactly at what level you want to hire, publish two job descriptions with two salary bands. If you’re worried about putting off people who are currently underpaid, acknowledge this in the job description and encourage them to apply anyway. If you’re worried about putting off people who earn more than the salary you’ve stated, adjust the salary you’ve stated.

And most importantly – if you’re worried that by publishing salaries on job descriptions your current staff will find out they’re underpaid, stop underpaying them.

Remember, if your company doesn’t show a salary or salary range, candidates will assume that you’re either trying to save money by underpaying candidates who don’t have the confidence to ask for more (often women and people of colour), or that you don’t want your current staff to know they’re underpaid. Both huge red flags.

## Walk the walk
Last month it was International Women’s Day. Cue tech companies like yours publicly about ‘celebrating’ and ‘empowering’ women.

**I don’t want to be celebrated. I don’t need to be empowered.**

**Instead, can you help me live in a world where I don’t get paid less, just because I was born a woman? Or where people aren’t paid less because of their ethnicity, sexuality, or disability?**

Instead of 'celebrating' and 'empowering' us, can you pledge to show the salary or salary range in all your job descriptions, and move us towards a world where we all know our market worth?

I will be bringing this up next time you’re on stage talking about diversity and inclusion. Walk the walk.
