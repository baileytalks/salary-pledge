# CV · Bailey Kursar

**Helping companies get closer to customers**

---

### I've been working in the fast paced world of financial technology for the last 10 years. I now specialise in helping companies design better products and services for customers using the inclusive design approach.

Having started in marketing, I have extensive experience conducting user research and turning research insights into strategy.

I've stepped into businesses to lead and deliver critical projects, working with developers, designers and analysts. I also work with founders to help them go from 'zero to one', or to unlock the next stage of growth.

> Getting the chance to work with Bailey has been an absolute pleasure.
Her work ethic is incredible and with her organisation, clear thought process and ability to multi task it's no wonder that the results speak for themselves.
*– Jenny McRobb, client at Funding Options*

## Touco Lab

*Co-founder, CEO, 2018-present*

In 2018 I started Toucan (now [Touco Lab](http://usetouco.com)) to build out Open Banking tools to help so-called 'vulnerable customers', particularly those affected by mental health problems.

We built two apps designed to help financial caregivers and their family members collaborate around money management, but unfortunately COVID-19 hit before we were able to secure a commercial contract to make the business sustainable.

At Touco I was responsible for securing funding, hiring the team, project managing the build of the app and running the user research. As part of our work I wrote a report on our pilot, *[Let's Talk About Money](http://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1d2vIgR8gc_isyK4j0rwahKeEalMoIXIP)* (click to download), and have delivered talks and workshops at conferences and with the Money Advice Trust's Vulnerability Academy.

## Consultant

*2017-present*

As a consultant I've worked with startups on product discovery, user research and on implementation, shipping new products and features, as well as early stage marketing strategy work. Clients have included Zopa, Autopaid and Funding Options. At Funding Options I led the successful project team for their Nesta Open Up Challenge entry.

In 2020 I started working with the Money Advice Trust as a consultant and trainer on their Vulnerability Academy programme, specialising in the FCA's new guidance on product design for vulnerable customers. As part of this collaboration I wrote an industry guide to inclusive design and vulnerability, [*Inclusive Design in Essential Services*](https://fairbydesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Inclusive-Design-Firms-Guide-Final.pdf), published by Fair By Design and the Money Advice Trust in January 2021.

## Monzo

*Marketing, 2016-2017*

I worked at challenger bank [Monzo](http://monzo.com) during their beta stage, going from around 10,000 cardholders to almost 100,000 when I left in January 2017, helping build the customer base during this critical time.

I also led a project to change the company name after a legal dispute meant they could not longer be 'Mondo'. We saw over 11,000 crowdsourced suggestions after we announced that we were changing the name. I worked on the name change announcement campaign, including a community event. I hired a community manager to work on social media strategy and a PPC expert to work on paid marketing experiments.

## MarketFinance

*Head of Marketing, 2013-2016*

Joined [MarketFinance](https://marketfinance.com/), the second biggest P2P business finance provider in Europe, to lead marketing at a crucial stage in the company’s growth.

At first I worked on implementing a basic acquisition and engagement strategy, starting with SEM (PPC, SEO), sales support content, email nurturing and content creation (blogs, video, infographics).

In the first six months I led a core rebrand, moving from a corporate-looking logo and colour palette to the new, modern, clean brand. As part of the project I led collaborative workshops, collated feedback and managed an external agency. We delivered on time and under budget.

Over my time in charge of the marketing team, I successfully sourced and hired a team of 5 and implemented a planning process and reporting framework. Key projects include a complete website redesign, running the first annual MarketFinance community event ('MIcon'), and launching an ad campaign on the London Underground.

> Bailey is a hard-working, passionate marketing expert. At MarketFinance she built a great team and directed them well. She cared deeply about the target audience and how we were helping them; this naturally translated into impactful ideas and campaigns.
*– Paul Crayston, colleague at MarketFinance*

## Funding Options

*Product and marketing, 2012-2013*

[Funding Options](http://fundingoptions.com) is a leading FinTech startup that aims to increase access to finance for UK SMEs. I joined pre-launch in 2012.

Joining a new business was a great opportunity to set up support and training processes from scratch. Among other things, I managed day-to-day marketing and ran a successful webinar program for accountants.

The Funding Options team matches businesses with lenders. Spreading the word about business finance options involved partnerships with the ICAEW and Forum of Private Business, among others.

As part of my role I co-hosted webinars with ABFA, Pension-led Funding and Funding Circle.

> "Bailey is sharp, quick-thinking and fun to work with.
She takes ownership of everything that crosses her path and is highly reliable; you never need to check or chase, she simply gets things done."
– *Emily Trant, manager at Funding Options*
